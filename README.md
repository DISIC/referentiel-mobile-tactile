# Technical reference for mobile/tactile platforms

## Warning

This technical reference is a work in progress. It capitalizes on the work currently being carried out within the framework of WCAG which does not yet propose criteria or techniques specific to the consultation situations on mobile/tactile platforms.

In particular, this reference uses the first results of the working group set up to fill this gap ([Mobile Accessibility: How WCAG 2.0 and Other W3C/WAI Guidelines Apply to Mobile](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/)).

In addition, WCAG also offers a selection of techniques applicable in mobile/tactile context ([WCAG 2.0 Techniques that Apply to Mobile](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/MobileTechniques/)).

Finally, this document is a continuation of the [RGAA&nbsp;3 (in French)](http://references.modernisation.gouv.fr/rgaa/) and in particular its [technical reference (in French)](http://references.modernisation.gouv.fr/rgaa/criteres.html), without which accessibility can not be measured. The links between these two references are numerous, therefore it is preferable to have some experience of the RGAA&nbsp;3.
